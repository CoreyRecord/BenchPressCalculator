// A variable in programming is a storage location that is paired with a name
// this variable contains information referred to as a value or data

// Scope is an association of a name to an entity like a variable
	
// Casting is when you assign a value to a data type to a different data type
// like int to double
	
// Data Types
// boolean are true and false only primitive data type
// byte is a designate 8 bit signed integer primitive data type
// char defines a charter as a primitive data type
// short is a 16 bit signed integer primitive data type
// int is a 32 bit signed integer primitive data type
// long is a 64 bit signed integer primitive data type
// float is a 32 bit float primitive data type that allows decimal
// double is a 64 bit float primitive data typethat needs to be store
